# Light Conditions Style Transfer

## Paper
[Lane Detection in Low-light Conditions Using an Efficient Data Enhancement : Light Conditions Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01177)

submitted to IV 2020

The main framework is as follows:
![Our framework](https://github.com/Chenzhaowei13/Light-Condition-Style-Transfer/blob/master/data/framework.png)


## Datasets

### CULane

The whole dataset is available at [CULane](https://xingangpan.github.io/projects/CULane.html).

### Generated Images

The  images in low-light conditions are generated by the proposed Better-CycleGAN.  We will upload our generated images in low-light conditions soon.

## Source Code

### Better-CycleGAN

We will open the source code for Better-CycleGAN soon.

### ERFNet

The source code used for the lane detction is made publicly available by [HOU Yuenan](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Lane-Detection/tree/master/ERFNet-CULane-PyTorch).


## Trained model

The trained models used in this paper are available in ./trained. (It can achieve 73.9 F1-measure in CULane testing set)


## Test model

### Requirements

- PyTorch 0.3.0.

- Matlab (for tools/prob2lines), version R2014a or later.

- Opencv (for tools/lane_evaluation), version 2.4.8 (later 2.4.x should also work).

### Test

1. Run test script
```
sh ./test_erfnet.sh
```

2. Get lines from probability maps

```
cd tools/prob2lines
matlab -nodisplay -r "main;exit"
```
Please check the file path in Matlab code before.

3. Evaluation

```
cd /tools/lane_evaluation
make
sh Run.sh # run.sh
```
Run.sh evaluate each scenario separately while run.sh evaluate the whole. The evaluation results are saved in /tools/lane_evaluation/output

## Performance

### Light-Conditions transfer

Some examples of real images in normal light conditions and their corresponding translations images in low-light conditions.

### Lane detetcion

Performance ( (F<sub>1</sub>-measure) ) of different methods on CULane testing set. For crossroad, only FP is shown.
