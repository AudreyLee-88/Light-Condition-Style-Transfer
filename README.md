## Paper
Lane Detection in Low-light Conditions Using an Efficient Data Enhancement : Light Conditions Style Transfer

Submit : IV 2020

The main framework is as follows:

![Our framework](https://github.com/Chenzhaowei13/Light-Condition-Style-Transfer/tree/master/data/framework.png)

## Source Code

1. Better-CycleGAN

We will open the source code for Better-CycleGAN soon.

2. ERFNet

The source code used for the lane detction is made publicly available by [HOU Yuenan](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Lane-Detection/tree/master/ERFNet-CULane-PyTorch)

## Datasets

### CULane

The whole dataset is available at [CULane](https://xingangpan.github.io/projects/CULane.html).

### Generated Images

The  images in low-light conditions are generated by the proposed Better-CycleGAN.  We will upload our generated images in low-light conditions soon.


## Trained model

The trained models used in this paper are available in ./trained


## Performance

1. Light-Conditions transfer

Some examples of real images in normal light conditions and their corresponding translations images in low-light conditions.

2. Lane detetcion

Performance ( (F<sub>1</sub>-measure) ) of different methods on CULane testing set. For crossroad, only FP is shown.
